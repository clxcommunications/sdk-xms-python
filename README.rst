REST API SDK for SMS
====================

This is the Python SDK for the CLX Communications REST API (also
called XMS) for sending and receiving single or batch SMS messages. It
also supports scheduled sends, organizing your frequent recipients
into groups, and customizing your message for each recipient using
parametrization.

This library is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.3 and later.

Getting Started
---------------

The SDK is packaged using setuptools_ and is available in the PyPI_
repository under the name clx-sdk-xms_. You can therefore, for
example, use pip_ to install the library using the command ``pip
install clx-sdk-xms``.

After installing the SDK it is recommended to read the tutorial_ and
`Client documentation`_.
